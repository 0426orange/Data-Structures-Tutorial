# Data-Structures-Tutorial

Welcome to the **Data Structures Tutorial**. Every programmer should understand these essential data structures:

1. [Stack](Stack.md)
2. [Set](Set.md)
3. [Tree](Tree.md) 

Each module will contain explanations, examples, and practice problems. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have made an honest attempt to solve the problem yourself.
