# Data-Structures-Tutorial

Welcome to the **Data Structures Tutorial**. Every programmer should understand these essential data structures:

1. **Stack**  
2. **Set**  
3. **Tree**  

Each module will contain explanations, examples, and practice problems. At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own. You should only look at the solution after you have made an honest attempt to solve the problem yourself.
