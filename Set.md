Sets in C#
Welcome to the Sets tutorial! A Set is a collection that contains unique elements. Sets are widely used in programming when you need to store unordered data and ensure there are no duplicate values.

In C#, sets are implemented using the HashSet<T> class in the System.Collections.Generic namespace.
